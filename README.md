# BSEC-SecurityTool

# About This Project
This repository contains various security-related scripts that I have written as part of my learning journey in cybersecurity and ethical hacking.

I am passionate about understanding network security, penetration testing, and system vulnerabilities, and these scripts help me practice and improve my skills in a safe and responsible way.

Everything here is designed for educational purposes only and should be used ethically and legally.
# Disclaimer & Legal Notice
This project is strictly for learning, research, and ethical hacking purposes.

*  Do not use these scripts on any system you do not own or have explicit permission to test.
*  I am not responsible for any misuse of this code.

Cybersecurity is a powerful skill—use it responsibly.

# Why I Am Writing These Scripts
I created this repository because:

* I want to learn cybersecurity by coding my own tools instead of just using existing ones.
* I believe in learning by doing, and scripting helps me understand how attacks and defenses work.
* I am exploring topics like network security, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessment.
* I am always open to feedback, so if you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to share!

#  Allowed Use Cases
*  Learning about network security & ethical hacking.
*  Practicing in a controlled environment (e.g., CTFs, lab setups).
*  Testing your own systems for vulnerabilities (with permission).
*  Understanding how attacks work to build stronger defenses.

#  Strictly Forbidden Uses
*  Running these scripts against unauthorized systems.
*  Using them for malicious hacking, illegal access, or data theft.
*  Disrupting or harming real-world services.
*  Violating any cybersecurity laws or ethical guidelines.
